Dividing scheme when data is too large to fit in memory.
1. using disk storage and split the record in the data into M files using hashing, store the contents of record u in file hash(u)%M. Then process each split in memory.
2. alternatively, hashing the records in the data and send them into the memory of mutiple(M) machines. Then process the data on each machine in parallel.

Advantage of solution 2:
parallel processing, fast
Disadvantage of Solution 2:
too many machines, node failure, complicate for implementation.
