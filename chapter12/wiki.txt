When coming out testing cases, be in a structured style.

Test a Real-world Object
  Step 1. who will use it, and why?
  Step 2. what are the use cases?
  Step 3. what are the bounds of use?
  Step 4. What are the stress/failure conditions.
  Step 5. How to perform the testing. automatically/manually?


Test a Piece of Software.
  1. Manual vs. Automated Testing
  2. Black Box/ White Box Testing.
  Step 1: Are we doing Black Box Testing or White Box Testing?
  Step 2: Who will use it, and why?
  Step 3: What are the use cases?
  Step 4: What are the bounds of use?
  Step 5: What are the stress conditions/failure conditions?
  Step 6: What are the test cases? How would you perform the testing?
          be in a structured style.


How to Test a Function
  Step 1. Define the Test Cases. test cases type:
    1. odd/even
    2. empty/non-empty
    3. small/large
    4. positive/negative
    5. legal/Illegal input
  
  Step 2. Define the expected result.
    1. If the function should not change the original array. we should validate that.
  
  Step 3. Write test code.

Troubleshooting Questions
  Step 1. Understand the Scenario
    1.1 How long it has been used? How long is the problem.
    1.2 what version. how often it happen, when does it happen?
    1.3 What is the error message?
  Step 2. Break down the problem.
    2.1 break into several steps, and check each step for problems.
  Step 3.
